✅Stream API — Key Points (Must Remember)

Introduced in Java 8

Used to process data, not store data

Works mainly with Collections & Arrays

Uses functional programming style

Supports method chaining

Stream pipeline has 3 parts
👉 Source → Intermediate → Terminal

Intermediate operations are lazy

Terminal operation triggers execution

Streams are single-use

Original collection does not change

Streams can be sequential or parallel

Supports lambda expressions & method references

filter, map, sorted → return Stream

forEach, collect, count → return result

map() = one-to-one
flatMap() = one-to-many

Streams internally use iteration, not external loops

Thread-safe by design (no shared mutable state)

🔥 Most Asked Interview Questions (with Short Answers)
1️⃣ What is Stream API?

Stream API is used to process collections in a functional and declarative way.

2️⃣ Difference between Stream and Collection?
Stream	      Collection
Process data	Store data
Lazy	        Eager
One-time use	Reusable
Functional	    OOP
3️⃣ What are intermediate operations?

Operations that return a Stream and are executed lazily
Examples: filter(), map(), sorted()

4️⃣ What are terminal operations?

Operations that return a result and start execution
Examples: forEach(), collect(), count()

5️⃣ Why Stream is lazy?

To improve performance by executing only when needed.

6️⃣ Can we reuse a Stream?

❌ No

stream.forEach(...);
stream.forEach(...); // IllegalStateException

7️⃣ Difference between map() and flatMap()?
map()	flatMap()
One-to-one	One-to-many
Returns Stream<Stream<T>>	Returns Stream<T>
8️⃣ What is method chaining?

Calling multiple methods in a single statement where each method returns an object.

9️⃣ Does Stream modify original collection?

❌ No, Streams are immutable

🔟 What is reduce()?

Used to combine stream elements into a single value.

int sum = list.stream().reduce(0, Integer::sum);

1️⃣1️⃣ What is parallelStream?

A stream that processes elements using multiple threads.

1️⃣2️⃣ When NOT to use parallel streams?

Small data

I/O operations

Order-sensitive operations

1️⃣3️⃣ What is Collectors?

Utility class to collect stream results into List, Set, Map

Collectors.toList()

1️⃣4️⃣ Difference between forEach() and forEachOrdered()?

forEach() → order not guaranteed

forEachOrdered() → maintains order

1️⃣5️⃣ What is internal iteration?

Iteration handled by JVM, not by programmer

⭐ Coding Questions Often Asked
Even numbers from list
list.stream()
    .filter(n -> n % 2 == 0)
    .forEach(System.out::println);

Count elements
long count = list.stream().count();

Max value
int max = list.stream().max(Integer::compare).get();
